# Create Performance Task
The create task requires that you write a program, capture the program running on video and answer several prompts about the program. You may find the [Create Performance Task presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bpOqdqQlrCZabjz6Q8FEpIEzRjp9hbxFfndLwMMyE8c/edit?usp=sharing) and this accompanying video helpful in understanding the create task.    

The college board has posted a large number of [sample create tasks with scores](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-principles/exam). Scroll down to the section *Scoring Guidelines and Notes for the 2019 Exam Administration* and you should find samples labled *CeateA* through *CreateJ*. The [scoring commentary](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap19-apc-csp-create.pdf) shows how each of the samples was graded. Pay particular attention to the examples like A and B that scored a perfect 8 out of 8.    

For more detailed information refer to the [Assessment Overview and Performance Task Directions](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-csp-student-task-directions.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles). Your create task needs to be submitted as final by the end of day Tuesday May 26th. In previous years there have been troubles with the College Board website, so try and submit it at least a day or two early. The college board provides a [template](https://secure-media.collegeboard.org/ap/misc/csp-create-template.dotx) that you can use to submit your create task. [Baker Franke's code print](https://bakerfranke.github.io/codePrint/) makes it easy to mark your algorithm with an oval and your abstraction with a rectangle.
